# AAD: Actual Arrival Date Calculation
## Summary
```
  This was a project that I that I had designed from scratch. Going through muyltiple review phases and selecting
  what technology to use to implement the solution.
```
# Technlogies
```
1. Java
2. AWS
  a. AWS Lambda
  b. AWS DynamoDB
```
# Technical Diffuculties
```
1. Figuring out how to read in over 1,000,000 differene SKU's and their details and loading it into DynamoDB. I opted
   to use multithreading to speed up the process but I still couldn't get rid of some data loss through the transfer.
   Since this project was for a demo that it was good enough.
